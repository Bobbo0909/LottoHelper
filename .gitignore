# Data files (often generated or too large for Git)
data/results/  # The raw yearly data, as this can be re-scraped
# data/cleaned/ # Consider ignoring if these can also be regenerated easily
#               # or if they become very large. For now, keep them if you want to commit cleaned data.
# If you choose to ignore cleaned, add:
# data/cleaned/*.csv
# data/cleaned/*.parquet

# Machine Learning models (if they become large, otherwise keep them)
