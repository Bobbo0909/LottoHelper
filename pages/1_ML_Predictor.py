        This tool uses two common machine learning models for prediction: **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting**.

        **How they work (Simplified):**
        Instead of trying to predict the *exact* next lottery numbers, these models are trained to learn patterns from the sequence of past draws. They analyze features from previous draws (like sums, parities, ranges, etc.) to infer which numbers are more likely to appear in the *next* draw, or what properties the next draw might have.

        The predictions displayed are generated by combining the outputs from both models. Numbers that both models indicate as having a higher probability are favored.

        * **Random Forest (RF):** Imagine a "forest" made up of many individual decision trees. Each tree in the forest makes its own prediction. For example, one tree might predict "number 7 is likely," another "number 12 is likely." The Random Forest then combines these individual predictions (e.g., by taking a vote or an average) to produce a more stable and accurate final prediction. It's excellent at handling complex relationships in data and reducing overfitting.
        * **Gradient Boosting (GB):** This is another powerful ensemble method, but it builds trees in a sequential manner. Each new tree that is added to the model attempts to correct the errors made by the previously built trees. It "learns" from the mistakes of its predecessors, gradually improving the overall prediction accuracy. Gradient Boosting models are known for their high performance in many predictive tasks.

        By leveraging both Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, we aim to gain a more robust and insightful set of predictions by considering different learning approaches and their combined strengths.
